# Linear Search

This folder contains a Java implementation of **Linear Search**, which is the simplest searching algorithm. It works on both **sorted** and **unsorted** arrays.

---

## Algorithm Logic

1. Start from the first element of the array.
2. Compare each element with the target.
3. If found, return the index.
4. If end of array is reached without finding the element, return `-1`.

## Time and Space Complexity

| Case        | Time Complexity | Auxiliary Space |
|-------------|------------------|------------------|
| Best Case   | O(1)             | O(1)             |
| Average Case| O(n)             | O(1)             |
| Worst Case  | O(n)             | O(1)             |

> `n` is the number of elements in the array.
